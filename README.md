## Text Sentiment in the Age of Enlightenment: An Analysis of Spectator Periodicals
This repository contains the code for the analysis conducted in the paper *Text Sentiment in the Age of Enlightenment: An Analysis of Spectator Periodicals*

## The Data
### Spectator Journals
We work with TEI encoded XML Files available at: https://gams.uni-graz.at/spectator.
This is a public digital edition curated by experts working in the fields of humanities [1].
All XML files need to be placed in the same dictionary.
Further you have to correctly set paths to files in the respective Jupyter Notebooks.
### Sentiment Dictionaries
The used dictionaries are available at: https://sites.google.com/site/datascienceslab/projects/multilingualsentiment.
These dictionaries were created and analyzed by Chen and Skiena [2].

## The Code
Code is available as Jupyter Notebooks. Execute the notebooks in the following order:

### 01_extract_data.ipynb
Used to extract texts and additional meta data from the XML files. You have to configure two paths:
1. data_dir: Pointing to the directory containing the XML files.
2. results_dir: Pointing to the directory where results should be stored.

### 02_conduct_analysis.ipynb
Used to conduct the analysis. Make sure that you set the *dataframe_input_path* to the pickled dataframe file from the extraction and to point *sentiment_dir* to the directory containing the downloaded sentiment dictionaries.
